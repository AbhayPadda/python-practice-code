Simple code in Python to solve the following problem: 
There is a river with a boat and a bank on each side; that's how rivers work.
On the left bank is a farmer with their wolf, goat and a cabbage.
The farmer keeps the peace, they're like a horse whisperer but for goats.
If the farmer is not around then the goat will eat the cabbage,
and the wolf will eat the goat. They must not be paired up alone.
Only the farmer can row the boat; cabbages don't have arms.
The boat has just 2 spaces because it's cheap, one for farmer one for object.
The farmer may be in the boat alone but other items must not be left in alone.
The farmer wants to get all his items to the other bank.
